Sadness,"""Sadness is a normal emotion that is triggered by a specific adverse event or bad experience. In other words, we become sad about something specific. This emotional state dissipates after some time or after something good, replaces the hurtful event that triggered the initial sadness. Sadness is temporary."""," A breakup, Losing someone important to you, Getting into a fight with someone you care about, Failing a test, Feeling lonely, Listening to a lot of sad music, Spending too much time on social media, Spending all your time indoors, Not getting enough rest, Not being active enough","MRI scans have shown that people who have recently been dumped have higher than normal activity in the region of the brain that registers physical pain. This triggers the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, leading to all kinds of physical symptoms, such as nausea, difficulty breathing, and also a weakening of the heart muscle that doctors call Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."," Listen to some music, Clean your room, Take a break from social media, Change your scenery, Be patient, Reward yourself",
Fear,"""Fear is, first and foremost, a survival mechanism. When the senses detect a source of stress that might pose a threat, the brain activates a cascade of reactions that prime us either to battle for our lives or to escape as quickly as possible — a reaction in mammals that is known as the ""fight-or-flight"" response."""," Change, Failure, Losing someone, The uncertainty of the future, Public Speaking, Taking a test, Job Interviews, Changing schools, Planning for the future, Paranoid, Deadlines, Stress, Fear of missing out","""When someone confronts an oncoming car or other danger, the eyes or ears (or both) send the information to the amygdala, an area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing. The amygdala interprets the images and sounds. When it perceives danger, it instantly sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus. When someone experiences a stressful event, the amygdala, an area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing, sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus. This area of the brain functions like a command center, communicating with the rest of the body through the nervous system so that the person has the energy to fight or flee"""," Face your fears, Exercise, Be scared, Think of the worst case scenario in a funny way, Limit social media use",
Vulnerability,“Vulnerability is about showing up and being seen. It’s tough to do that when we’re terrified about what people might see or think.”," End of a relationship, Insecurity, Trauma","“Emotional vulnerability is a state of weakness that can be brought on by the end of a relationship, insecurities or a number of other reasons. Being emotionally vulnerable means that you’re not emotionally stable enough to sustain a thriving, healthy relationship. Pinpointing whether or not you have this vulnerability is the first step to working out how to overcome it.”"," Open up and admit your vulnerabilities, Look into why you react when your pain buttons are triggered, Remember that vulnerability is not a bad thing",
Exhaustion,"""Mental exhaustion can happen to anyone who experiences long-term stress. It can make you feel overwhelmed and emotionally drained, and make your responsibilities and problems seem impossible to overcome."""," Feeling pressured, Lack of a work-life balance, A lot of decision-making, Stress, Heavy workload, Lack of socializing, Significant change, Lack of control, Lack of social support","""Stress is something everyone experiences from time to time. It’s our body’s natural response to positive and negative situations that are new, exciting, or scary. This biological response results in a surge of stress hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol. This boost of hormones helps us react quickly to perceived threats and high-pressure situations that require quick thinking. Once the stressor has been removed, your body should go back to normal. Mental exhaustion is usually the result of long-term stress. When you’re continually dealing with things that activate your body’s stress response, your cortisol levels remain high. Eventually, this begins to interfere with normal body functions, such as digestion, sleep, and your immune system.”"," Take a break, Yoga, Deep breathing, Be more mindful, Make less decisions",
Envy,"“Envy refers to the often-painful emotion caused by an awareness of an advantage enjoyed by another person. It is a complex, socially repugnant emotion made up of a mix of inferiority feelings, hostility, and resentment. Envy is different from admiration, which is delight and approval inspired by another person. Admiration can foster a desire to emulate another person’s success, whereas envy breeds a competitive desire to outdo and even bring the envied person down in some cases.”"," Low self esteem, Insecurity, A glamorized perception of other peoples live, A lack of success in something, Constantly comparing yourself to others, Competitiveness, Failing in something someone else is succeeding in",“Envy is hypothesized to have been shaped by selection to facilitate successful social competition for access to resources that affect fitness. A central component of successful resource competition is rendering oneself more deserving of the resources one is competing for relative to others who are striving to achieve the same goal.”," Focus on yourself, Talk about it, Remember that social media isn’t an accurate representation of people’s lives, Turn your envy into gratitude, Change the way you think about things",
Jealousy,"""Jealousy involves thinking you will lose, or have lost, some affection or security from another person because of someone or something else—including their interest in an activity that takes time away from you."""," Possessiveness, Lack of trust, Previous experience, Projecting your fears onto your partner","""A clear correlation emerged between lowered self-esteem and increased jealousy, which was particularly marked in women, for whom robust self-esteem was virtually incompatible with high jealousy concerns."""," Think about why you’re jealous, Focus on yourself, Talk about it, Remember that social media isn’t an accurate representation of people’s lives, Change the way you think about things",
Anger,"""Anger is one of the basic human emotions, as elemental as happiness, sadness, anxiety, or disgust. These emotions are tied to basic survival and were honed over the course of human history. Anger is related to the “fight, flight, or freeze” response of the sympathetic nervous system; it prepares humans to fight. What many people don’t realize is that anger is a secondary emotion. What does this mean?  Typically, one of the primary emotions, like fear or sadness, can be found underneath the anger. The so-called affective neurosciences have shown the phylogenetic origin of the two circuits underlying the emergence of anger along with its evolutionary role for promoting survival. This view has been integrated by the psychodynamic theory of motivational systems that attribute a double role to anger: on the one hand, this affect works as an inwardly directed signal concerning a pressure to overcome an obstacle or an aversive situation; on the other hand, anger is also an outwardly directed communicative signal establishing differentiation and conflict within interpersonal relationships and affective bonds."""," Frustration, Lack of control, Failure, Sadness, Tiredness, Jealousy, Feeling disrespected, Feeling undervalued, Feeling cheated, Shame","“As you become angry your body's muscles tense up. Inside your brain, neurotransmitter chemicals known as catecholamines are released causing you to experience a burst of energy lasting up to several minutes. This burst of energy is behind the common angry desire to take immediate protective action. At the same time your heart rate accelerates, your blood pressure rises, and your rate of breathing increases. Your face may flush as increased blood flow enters your limbs and extremities in preparation for physical action. Your attention narrows and becomes locked onto the target of your anger. Soon you can pay attention to nothing else. In quick succession, additional brain neurotransmitters and hormones (among them adrenaline and noradrenaline) are released which trigger a lasting state of arousal. You're now ready to fight.”"," Exercise, Meditate, Lighten Up, Listen to Music, Write down your emotions, Talk about it, Identify what’s causing your anger",
Stress,"“Stress is the body's reaction to any change that requires an adjustment or response. The body reacts to these changes with physical, mental, and emotional responses. Stress is a normal part of life. You can experience stress from your environment, your body, and your thoughts. Even positive life changes can produce stress. Stress, in everyday terms, is a feeling that people have when they are overloaded and struggling to cope with demands.These demands can be related to finances, work, relationships, and other situations, but anything that poses a real or perceived challenge or threat to a person’s well-being can cause stress.”"," Noises, Aggressive behavior, Scary moments in movies, Going out on a first date, Emotional experience, School, High expectation, Social media, Overthinking, Job issues or retirement, Lack of time or money, Bereavement, Family problems, Illness, Moving to another environment, Relationships, Marriage, Divorce","“Research suggests that stress can bring on or worsen certain symptoms or diseases. Stress is linked to 6 of the leading causes of death: heart disease, cancer, lung ailments, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver, and suicide. Stress is the body’s natural defense against predators and danger. It flushes the body with hormones to prepare systems to evade or confront danger. This is known as the “fight-or-flight” mechanism. When we are faced with a challenge, part of our response is physical. The body activates resources to protect us by preparing us either to stay and fight or to get away as fast as possible.The body produces larger quantities of the chemicals cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. These trigger an increased heart rate, heightened muscle preparedness, sweating, and alertness. All these factors improve the ability to respond to a hazardous or challenging situation. Stress slows normal bodily functions, such as the digestive and immune systems. All resources can then be concentrated on rapid breathing, blood flow, alertness, and muscle use.”","Time management, Think positively, Learn to say no, Accept that there are events that you cannot control, Exercise, Make time for hobbies, Be assertive instead of aggressive, Avoid alcohol, Avoid caffeine, Meditation, Get enough sleep, Eat healthy",
Anxiousness,"“Anxiety is a feeling of unease, worry or fear. Everyone feels anxious at some point in their life, but for some people it can be an ongoing problem. A little bit of anxiety can be helpful; for example, feeling anxious before an exam might make you more alert and improve your performance. But too much anxiety could make you tired and unable to concentrate.”"," Stress from Schoolwork/ Academics, Stress from Jobs/ Worklife, Being extremely self conscious, Being discluded in a big group of people, Caffeine, Skipping meals, Being in a low oxygen/high altitude area, Comparing yourself to something on social media","""A mental toll takes a physical toll, just as anxiety can have an effect on your body. You can feel more jittery, your heart starts pounding more, you have a loss of appetite (or eat more), you need to use the bathroom frequently, and your breath becomes shorter. Feeling anxious can also make you more irritable(which makes you lash out more), not being able to relax, and having sleeping difficulties (can’t sleep regularly, enough, or too much)."""," Get enough sleep, Meditate, Exercise, Eat healthy, Avoid alcohol, Avoid caffeine",
Procrastination,"“Everyone puts things off sometimes, but procrastinators chronically avoid difficult tasks and may deliberately look for distractions. Procrastination in large part reflects struggles with self-control as well as the general human inability to accurately predict how we will feel tomorrow, or the day after.” "," Perfectionism, Tiredness, Feeling overwhelmed, Low self confidence, Fear of failure, Distractions, Lack of interest in task","“Dr. Heath believes that procrastination is actually a defense mechanism. “Your unconscious mind thinks it is helping you. But it is misguided. So the procrastinator’s mind uses a defense mechanism—repression—to kind of forget about the task. ‘Oh, there are so many other things I need to do.’ And the procrastinator usually minimizes the amount of time the task will take. This, of course, is the trick our mind plays with us. It hopes the task will go away.”","Think positively, Reward yourself, Think of how the task fits into the bigger picture,Let yourself fail, Make a plan, Start with easier tasks",
